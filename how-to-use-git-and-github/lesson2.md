`diff -u <old-file> <new-file>`

This command compares `<new-file>` with `<old-file>`.
This command tells you what have been changed compared with `<old-file>`.
The `-u` option is used when comparing two files instead of two commit verions.


`git diff`: Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.

`git clone`: Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.

`git checkout`: Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit. It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore.

`git log`: Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.

It is possible to copy a directory from one computer to another using the command `scp`, which stands for "secure copy". 
The name was chosen because the scp command lets you securely copy a directory from one computer to another.

`git diff` with commit IDs: To make the options on the next screen easier to read, only the first 6 characters of each commit ID have been included. This will not change the output of git diff unless two commits start with the same 6 characters.
